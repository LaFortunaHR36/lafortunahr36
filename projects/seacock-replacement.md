# Seacocks replacement with TruDesign

I am writing this guide prior to replacing the seacocks in order to get familiar with the task, the parts, the tools and recommendations from other boat owners. It is my reference guide and if it helps others even better.

The guide is specifically tailored to replace old bronze seacocks by TruDesign ones on a Hallberg Rassy 36 MKII. I have written this guide with the help of several HR boat owners.

This is the current distribution of seacocks on my HR 36. The shape within the circle represents the type of thru-hull whether straight, or 90%/L shape. When I see a Y shape, I mean that right after the valve there is a Y hole tails. The thru-hull in those Y seacocks are really 90 degree fitting connected to a valve and then a Y hole tail.

Note 1): I use the term **seacock** to refer to the combination of : skin-fittings + valve + hose tail.
Note 2): I use the acronym **TH** for through-hulls for brevity

## Required Tools

- Heat gun - useful to remove pipes which are glued to the hose tails
- Pipe wrench
- Hack saw - useful to cut the flange from old seacock or just to make the hole wider
- Step drill - to remove the old seacock by grinding it off

## Parts to purchase

- skin-fittings standard size and long size
- valve of various sizes
- hose tail
- innox clamps (should we had to replace old ones)

## Existing parts

- backing plates
- pipes


## 1 Remove old TH

I start removing hose clamps and the hose from the valve or pipe connector.
If it is too hard, I use a heat gun.

Now, to remove the old TH I have to decide whether I want to keep the hole as it is
, i.e the new TH has the same Outer diameter. Or instead I want to make the hole wider.

## 1.a Use same hole for new TH

I use a step drill from outside of the boat to remove the flange. It also heats up the TH little bit which softens original sealant.

Once I have removed the flange and part of the TH, I go inside the boat and with just my hands, I rotate the valve+TH combo to remove it totally.

## 1.b Make wider hole for new TH

To remove the old TH and make the hole bigger there are two techniques:
- Use a wood bung and a hole saw with the outer diameter of the new TH
- Use two hole saw. One with the outer diameter of the new TH and another one of the same diameter of the inner diameter of the old TH which serves a guide

## 2. Prepare hole for the new thru-hull

Sand hull surface, using 80 grit, around the hole to remove all antifouling paint. This is to achieve better bonding between hull and the flange of the new thru-hull with the sealant.

Sand the hole's walls to remove any sealant. If it is too difficult to remove it, we use a dremel stone.

Ensure the hole is absolutely dry without any humidity. Also ensure the backing plate is dry without any humidity.

Apply a coat of epoxy resin (without filler) around and inside the hole to ensure the fiberglass or inner core does not get absorb any water/humidity. Also around the hull surface where it will sit the skin-fitting's flange.

Sand the epoxy surface to improve bonding and clean with acetone.


## 3. Fit dry the thru-hull

**Which skin-fitting shall I use?** *standard* or *long size*? Standard skin fitting domed is 66mm long and the long skin fitting domed is 140mm long but requires a minimum hull thickness of 33mm.
Once I remove my old THs, I will know exactly how think the hull is but I am gathering from other HR owners that our hulls are rather thick, in between 40mm and 50mm. So, long skin fitting seems appropriate.

1. Insert the thru-hull and hold it with some tape so that you can go inside the boat
2. Go inside and insert the washer, the nut and valve onto the thru-hull
3. Measure how much to cut the thru-hull: Distance between nut the valve
4. Cut the excess with a hack saw. Insert the nut before cutting so that it helps us later to redo any bits of the thread damaged

Now we have the thru-hull of the right length.

## 4. Fit dry the whole seacock

1. Once you have the thru-hull inserted into the hole
2. Go inside of the boat
3. Screw the ring, the nut and value , hand tight, no more
4. Insert the hose connector onto the valve. If possible, without any kind of reductions.
5. Insert the hole
6. Now, with everything in place, ensure I can open and close the valve without any problems
7. Once everything is aligned, I mark the position in the hull with a marker or a blue tape so that I know the position I should tight the valve again

## 5. Fit thru-hull

Note: I have read that it is recommended to sand the thru-hull for better bonding of the sealant/epoxy.

1. Put masking tape on the thread where the valve screws in. This is just in case sealing/proxy gets there. We should apply some thread sealant to the threads but try to leave 1/4'' without any sealant to avoid any sealant from getting into the valve itself and blocking it.
2. Apply sealant to the inside of the flange and the thread that will stay in between the hull.
3. Insert the thru-hull across the hole in the hull
4. Go inside and fill up any void with more sealant.
5. Insert the washer and nut and hand tight it and leave it until it cures. Clean any excess of sealant.
  Note: It’s important there’s sealant between the hull and washer and between the washer and nut, so to ensure this the nut need only be finger-tight so it doesn’t squeeze all the sealant out, allowing the sealant to do its job.

6. Once it has cured, remove the masking tape on the thread where we are going to screw the valve
7. Tight the nut a bit more (15ft lb). How much is that?
8. Apply thread-selant of your preference, e.g. loctite 55, across the threads not following them
9. Screw the valve in and the hose adapter and let it cure before inserting the hoses


Don't you prefer to remove the excess of sealant while fresh rather than cut it away when dry with a knife or cutter?

**Note**:
- Throw away the old hose innox clamps if they have some rust

## 6. Attach the strainer

You can epoxy the strainer to the hull with a west type system or a strong marine sealant like 3M Fastcure 5200 would also work.

Roughen the hull in the shape of the strainer where it will touch the hull, apply the sealant to the whole underside surface of the strainer. Finally, angle the sealant around the outside shape of the strainer to the hull and this will lock the strainer and stop any movement.
