# Replace anodes

There are 4 anodes in total. Here they are:
- Shaft anode (30mm shaft)
- MaxProp propeller anode (size: ?)
- Hull anode (space between bolts?, size: 2kg)
- BowTruster anode

## Replace shaft anode

In between the cutlass bearing and the propeller there is very limited space.
In that space, from stern to bow, we have the [rope cutter](https://shop.hallberg-rassy.com/contents/en-us/d308_Rope_Cutter.html) and the anode.

**IMPORTANT**: For a 30 mm shaft, like the one we have, you have to leave 30mm/2 = 15 mm clearance in front of the cutlass bearing. This space is to allow for the propeller and engine motions and so that it does not restrict water ingress necessary for the stern gland to keep the shaft lubricated, or at least, not dry.
