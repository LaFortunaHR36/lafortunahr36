# Replace anodes

There are 4 anodes in total. Here they are:
- Shaft anode (30mm shaft)
- MaxProp propeller anode (size: ?)
- Hull anode (space between bolts?, size: 2kg)
- BowTruster anode

## Replace shaft anode

The shaft has in between the cutlass bearing and the propeller very limited space.
It has the anode and the [rope cutter](https://shop.hallberg-rassy.com/contents/en-us/d308_Rope_Cutter.html).

**IMPORTANT**: For a 30 mm shaft, you would require 30mm/2 = 15 mm between front surface of the rope cutter and the aft edge of the cutlass bearing. This space is to allow for the propeller and engine motions.
