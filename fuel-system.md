# Fuel System

We have a day-tank and a reserve-tank. day-tank is never emptied beyond 3/4. This is used to calculate fuel consumption. When the tank reaches the 3/4, we take note of the number of engine hours and calculate the difference with the number of engine hours when the day-tank was full. Then we open the valve to empty the reserve-tank into the day-tank until the latter is full again.
We should now fill up the reserve-tank.


Notes:
- Return-line should enter the tank as far as from the takeoff line as possible to prevent the drawing of foaming fuel into the pickup. The minimum workable distance is 38 cmts, but more is always better.

## Tanks

It is best to recommend not top- ping off tanks 100 percent. If the tank is topped off with cool fuel, the fuel can heat up and expand enough to spill 2 or 3 gallons (7 to 11 L) overboard through the vent. Vent-line must have a gooseneck of at least 10cmt or higher. 

## Future projects

Changing pre-filters has been a nightmare. Priming air from the circuit took ages because when the pre-filter is removed, the intake line empties entirely.
This means that all that air has to be removed.

There are a few alternatives:
- Add a shutoff valve near the pre-filter on the intake line. However, I dont know how effective it can be if I am not able to fully load of diesel the pre-filter. It is a CAV filter type.
- Use the manual pipe to suck fuel and hopefully eliminate the air by opening the priming screw of the pre-filter. Careful when selecting values. They must be meant for fuel.
